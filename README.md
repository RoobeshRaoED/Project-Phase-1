## QUANTUM-ENHANCED FEDERATED LEARNING FOR PRIVACY-PRESERVING AGENTIC AI IN 6G EDGE NETWORKS
The project focuses on building a secure, intelligent, and privacy-preserving AI system using federated learning enhanced with quantum-inspired optimization techniques, enabling real-time agentic decision-making over ultra-low-latency 6G edge networks.

## ABOUT
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Quantum-Enhanced Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Agentic AI in 6G Edge Networks is a next-generation AI system designed to enable collaborative intelligence across decentralized edge devices without compromising sensitive data. Traditional centralized AI models require raw data sharing, which raises serious privacy, security, and regulatory concerns—especially in healthcare and critical domains.

This project addresses these challenges by integrating Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, Homomorphic Encryption, and Quantum-Inspired Optimization (QAOA) within a simulated 6G edge environment. AI agents perform local training on private data, share only encrypted model updates, and contribute to a global model optimized using quantum-inspired techniques for faster convergence.

The system also incorporates agentic AI diagnosis modes, allowing users to interact with specialized AI agents (e.g., general health, cardiovascular, respiratory). The architecture ensures privacy preservation, scalability, and real-time responsiveness, making it suitable for future intelligent healthcare, smart cities, and edge AI ecosystems.
